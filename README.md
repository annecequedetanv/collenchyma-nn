collenchyma-NN provides the traits to support Neural Network related algorithms for [collenchyma][collenchyma],
so you can use NN operations on servers, desktops or mobiles with OpenCL, CUDA
and common host CPU support. But note, this crate only provides the traits, the
actual implementation can be found at [collenchyma][collenchyma].

If you would like to write your own backend-agnostic, high-performance library, you can  
* take this library as an example for basically copy&paste,
* glance over the docs for a broader overview
* and [notify us about your library][gitter-collenchyma] - we are happy to feature your collenchyma library on the collenchyma README.

collenchyma-NN was started at [Autumn][autumn] to support the Machine Intelligence
Framework [Leaf][leaf] with backend-agnostic, state-of-the-art performance.

For more information,

* see collenchyma-NN's [Documentation](http://autumnai.github.io/collenchyma-nn)
