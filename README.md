collenchyma-NN provides Neural Network related algorithms for [Collenchyma][collenchyma].
Run NN operations on servers, desktops or mobiles, GPUs, FPGAs or CPUS, without
carrying about OpenCL or CUDA support on the machine.

collenchyma-NN was started at [Autumn][autumn] to support the Machine Intelligence
Framework [Leaf][leaf] with backend-agnostic, state-of-the-art performance.

For more information,

* see collenchyma-NN's [Documentation](http://autumnai.github.io/collenchyma-nn)
* visit [Collenchyma][collenchyma] for more information about portable operations and other Plugins.
* or get in touch on [Twitter][twitter-autumn] or [Gitter][gitter-collenchyma]

## Provided Operations

This Plugins provides the following operations to the Collenchyma Backend.
Every Operation includes forward + backward. A `-` means not yet implemented.
More information can be found in the [Documentation][docs-ops].

| Operation            | CUDA       | OpenCL    | Native    |
|---	                 |---	        |---        |---        |

Kudos to [ehiggs][ehiggs], for implementing the native Rust operations.

## Getting Started

If you're using Cargo, just add collenchyma-NN to your Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    collenchyma = "0.0.7"
    collenchyma-nn = "0.2.1"

If you're using [Cargo Edit][cargo-edit], you can call:

    $ cargo add collenchyma-nn

[cargo-edit]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

## Usage

Bring the Plugin trait and the other important Collenchyma traits/structs in scope and
you will be able to execute the here provided operations on your Collenchyma Backend.

```rust
extern crate collenchyma as co;
extern crate collenchyma_nn as nn;
use co::backend::{Backend, BackendConfig};
use co::framework::IFramework;
use co::frameworks::Cuda;
use co::tensor::SharedTensor;
use nn::*;
fn main() {
    // Initialize a CUDA Backend.
    // Usually you would not use CUDA but let it pick what is available on the machine.
    let framework = Cuda::new();
    let hardwares = framework.hardwares();
    let backend_config = BackendConfig::new(framework, hardwares);
    let backend = Backend::new(backend_config).unwrap();
    // Initialize two SharedTensors.
    // Usually you would want also fill them with data.
    let mut x = SharedTensor::<f32>::new(backend.device(), &(1, 1, 3)).unwrap();
    let mut result = SharedTensor::<f32>::new(backend.device(), &(1, 1, 3)).unwrap();
    // Use the operation provided by this Plugin.
    backend.sigmoid(&mut x, &mut result);
}
```
